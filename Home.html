            <h1>Programme Objective <br>and Rationale</h1>
            <p>At Sushant University, we encourage inter and trans-disciplinary approach to teaching and learning across all programmes of study for a holistic learning and all round development. The central idea of the approach is to educate students in the exploration and utilization of diverse approaches to critical thinking and to participatory and interactive learning so that they make connections among multiple disciplines, work jointly with students from other Schools on an area of common interest, co-create knowledge, construct their own meaning and transfer the learning to real world applications. To expand learning opportunities for students in a programme, there are trans-disciplinary modules or courses which provide opportunities for higher-level learning outcomes, besides bringing flexibility in programme delivery. Such courses constitute an elective programme embedded in all programmes of study of the University.</p>
